$1 (Birth → 6 months and beyond)
**Physical recovery (typical):**
- First 24–72 hours: bleeding (lochia) commonly heavy then gradually reduces and changes colour (from bright red → pink → brown → yellowish) over weeks.
- Uterine involution can cause cramping, especially during breastfeeding.
- Perineal tenderness or incision soreness (if applicable) improves gradually over days–weeks.
- Hormonal shifts may cause night sweats, temperature sensitivity, and emotional changes.

**Normal postpartum symptoms (non‑emergency):**
- Mild abdominal cramping (“afterpains”).
- Fatigue, sleep fragmentation.
- Breast fullness, engorgement, or leaking milk.
- Mood swings in first 1–2 weeks (“baby blues”).
- Mild swelling of legs/feet.
- Constipation or hemorrhoid discomfort.

**Daily routine template (first 6 weeks):**
- **Rest:** sleep when the baby sleeps; avoid heavy lifting until cleared.
- **Hydration:** frequent water intake, especially if breastfeeding.
- **Nutrition:** balanced meals with iron, protein, and fiber to aid recovery.
- **Breast/chest care:** feed or express regularly; look for redness or hard lumps.
- **Activity:** short walks daily; avoid strenuous exercise until cleared.
- **Emotional check-ins:** track mood; seek support from family/community.

**When to contact a clinician (educational):**
- Fever, severe abdominal pain, foul-smelling discharge, very heavy bleeding, severe headaches, sudden swelling, persistent depression or anxiety, or any concerning symptoms.

**6-week and ongoing checks:**
- Physical healing, blood pressure review, anemia check if needed.
- Mental health screening.
- Breastfeeding support.
- Family planning/contraception options.
- Clearance for exercise and sexual activity varies; follow clinician guidance.

### Extended postpartum (6 weeks → 6 months)
**Physical recovery:**
- Energy gradually improves; core and pelvic floor strength return with gentle exercise.
- Menstruation may return depending on breastfeeding patterns.

**Daily care:**
- Continue nutritious meals, hydration, and gradual fitness.
- Monitor mental well-being; postpartum depression can appear months later.

**Infant bonding and routine:**
- Establishing sleep patterns, feeding schedules, and responsive caregiving.

## 5) Infant care & development (Birth → 24 months) & development (Birth → 24 months)
> Organized by age blocks: Birth, 0–6 months, 6–12 months, 12–24 months

### Birth (Day 0–7)
**Immediate events & normal findings:**
- Meconium: dark green/black sticky stool produced in first 1–3 days — normal. Transition to yellow/brown stools occurs after feeding established.
- Feeding: initiate breastfeeding within first hour if possible; feed on demand.
- Output: monitor wet diapers and stools; clinical teams monitor newborn vitals and feeding.

**Daily routine (parents):**
- Night/day feeding on demand, skin-to-skin contact, hygiene, cord care as instructed by provider.

**Vaccinations & checks:**
- In many countries, a hepatitis B dose is given at birth; follow local immunization schedules and provider advice. (Schedules differ by country and may change; check local guidance.)


### Infant 0–6 months
**Feeding:**
- Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by WHO/UNICEF for the first 6 months where feasible (no other foods or water), with continued breastfeeding alongside complementary foods thereafter up to 2 years and beyond.
- If formula is used, prepare as per safe guidelines and local medical advice.

**Daily routine template:**
- Feed on demand; daytime and nighttime feeding; responsive soothing; safe sleep on back; tummy time when awake and supervised for development.

**Milestones & normal behaviours:**
- Social smile by ~6–8 weeks; improved head control by 2–3 months; rolling may begin around 4–6 months.

**Vaccinations & checks:**
- Follow local 0–6 month immunization schedule (commonly vaccines at 6, 10, 14 weeks or 2, 4, 6 months depending on country) — examples include DTP-containing vaccines, polio, Hib, pneumococcal, rotavirus, hepatitis B series. Exact timing varies by country.


### Infant 6–12 months
**Feeding & introduction of solids:**
- Begin complementary (solid) foods around 6 months while continuing breastfeeding. Start with iron-rich purees (e.g., fortified cereals, pureed meats, legumes) and slowly introduce textures.
- Introduce one new food at a time and watch for signs of allergic reactions per local guidance.

**Daily routine:**
- Multiple small meals and snacks, continued on-demand breastfeeding, regular sleep schedule, supervised play for motor and social skills.

**Milestones:**
- Sitting without support (6–9 months), crawling, babbling, first teeth erupting, developing pincer grasp around 9–12 months.

**Vaccinations & checks:**
- Continue scheduled immunizations (for example measles-containing vaccine timing varies by region — commonly at 9 or 12 months depending on national schedules). Use national immunization program guidance.


### Toddler 12–24 months
**Feeding:**
- Continue breastfeeding as desired; provide a variety of family foods and ensure iron-rich, diverse diet.
- Cow’s milk introduction timing varies by guidance; many places recommend whole milk after 12 months (if breastfeeding not used) and limit to recommended daily amounts.

**Daily routine:**
- Three meals and healthy snacks, encourage self-feeding, continue vaccination schedule as per local program.

**Milestones:**
- Walking independently, saying first words and combining words, improved self-feeding and fine motor skills, beginning toilet learning signs may appear later in this window.

**Vaccinations & checks:**
- Continued immunizations per national schedule and routine developmental/vision/hearing checks as advised.

## 6) Appendix — Quick reference checklists

### Antenatal checklist (early pregnancy to late pregnancy)
- Start or continue folic acid before conception and in early pregnancy per clinician.
- Book first antenatal visit early in pregnancy.
- Attend recommended antenatal contacts (WHO suggests at least 8 contacts where feasible).
- Prepare birth plan and emergency contact information.

### Postpartum checklist (mother)
- Arrange postpartum check around 6 weeks (or earlier if concerns).
- Watch for signs of postpartum depression or severe anxiety.
- Ensure contraception counseling if desired.

### Newborn urgent signs (seek immediate care)
- Poor feeding or not waking to feed, hard to breathe, blue lips or face, persistent high fever, continuous crying, seizures, very low urine output, or signs of infection at the umbilical cord site.
